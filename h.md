To upload a Python script or project to GitHub, you'll typically follow these steps:

### 1. Set Up Git on Your Local Machine

First, ensure that Git is installed on your machine. If you haven't installed it yet, download and install it from [Git's official site](https://git-scm.com/).

### 2. Initialize Your Local Git Repository

If you haven't already initialized a Git repository in your project folder, open a terminal and navigate to your project directory:

```bash
cd path/to/your/project
```

Once inside the directory, initialize Git:

```bash
git init
```

### 3. Create a GitHub Repository

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create a new repository. Make sure to copy the URL of the new repository, which should look something like:

```
https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
```

### 4. Add Your Files and Commit

Now, go back to your terminal (inside your project directory) and run the following commands to add your files and commit them.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### 5. Add Remote Repository (GitHub)

To link your local repository to the remote GitHub repository, use the following command, replacing `repository-url` with the URL you copied earlier.

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
```

### 6. Push to GitHub

Finally, push your code to GitHub:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

If this is your first time pushing to GitHub, you might be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password (or use a personal access token if two-factor authentication is enabled).

### Optional: Python Script Example

Let's say you have a simple Python script called `example.py`. You can follow the steps above to push it to GitHub. Here's a basic script you might want to upload:

```python
# example.py

def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    greet("World")
```

After following the steps, this script will be uploaded to your GitHub repository.
